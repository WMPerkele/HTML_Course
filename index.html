		<h1> Jarno Laaksonen - Game programmer </h1>
		<h2> What is this web site for? </h2>
		<p> 
		This my practise web page where i will compile some simple examples of what i can do.
		These things include what im up to now as well as my previous published and unpublished works. 
		The work that i have gotten through publishing will have links on them as well as explanations of what i did in them
		</p>
		<h2>Who am i? </h2>
		<p> 
		My name is Jarno Laaksonen, i'm a beginner game programmer who has interests in general game programming 
		and graphics programming with shaders and meshes. So far i have taken part in one published game and done multiple
		student projects in small teams. Im on my final year of university to graduate as a programmer and hope to transition
		straight into game dev industry as a junior programmer.
		</p>
		<h2>What am i up to right now? </h2>
		As of writing im not employed yet, however hopefully that is so change after graduation is certain.
		I will start applying to every damn place i can find and hope that one of the applications stick to the wall of jobs.
		Until i have a job i will keep reading up and training as a graphics programming by doing tutorials and studying books such
		as "Real-time rendering" and "Physics based rendering" and try to get as much knowledge as i can.
